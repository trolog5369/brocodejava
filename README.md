# 🚀 BroCode Java Learning Journey

This is my personal learning repository to track my daily progress learning Java, following Bro Code's Java Full Course. 💻

## 📂 Structure
- **Week-01/**
  - **Day-01/** → Hello World, Variables, Print Statements
  - **Day-02/** → User Input, Small Mad Libs Project
- **Projects/** → Mini-projects I build while learning
- **Resources/** → Notes, links, references

## 🎯 Goal
To build a strong foundation in Core Java before moving on to Spring Boot and Full Stack development.

## 📝 Workflow
- Each day has its own folder with code files and a `README.md` for notes.
- Weekly summaries are added in `Summary.md` inside each week folder.
