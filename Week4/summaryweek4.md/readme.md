# 🚀 Week 04 — BroCode Java Learning Journey

### 📘 Overview
Week 4 was the **true beginning of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in depth.  
This week covered how objects are created, how constructors work, how classes relate to each other, and how Java uses inheritance and polymorphism to build scalable systems.

I learned the backbone of **real-world Java**, used in frameworks like Spring Boot.

---

# 📂 Daily Breakdown

---

## **Day 01 — Constructors 🏗️**
- Learned how objects are initialized using:
  - Default constructor  
  - Parameterized constructor  
- Understood why constructors run *automatically* when an object is created.  
- Used `this` to differentiate between class attributes and parameters.

---

## **Day 02 — Constructor Overloading 🔄**
- Created multiple constructors with different parameter lists.  
- Allowed flexible object creation.  
- Practiced assigning default values when parameters are missing.

---

## **Day 03 — Arrays of Objects 📦**
- Stored multiple objects inside an array.  
- Iterated using `for` and `for-each` loops.  
- Modified object attributes through loops.  
- Saw how arrays + objects allow structured data handling.

---

## **Day 04 — Static Keyword ⚡**
- Understood that:
  - Static variables are **shared across all objects**.
  - Static methods belong to the **class**, not the objects.
- Gave examples like a friend counter using static fields.  
- Used the built-in `Math` class to understand static utility functions.

---

## **Day 05 — Inheritance 🧬**
- Used `extends` to form parent–child class relationships.  
- Implemented **single**, **multi-level**, and **hierarchical** inheritance.  
- Class hierarchy example:

Organism
│
├── Animal
│ ├── Dog
│ └── Cat
│
└── Plant


- Learned that subclasses can have both inherited + unique features.

---

## **Day 06 — The `super` Keyword 🧓➡️🧒**
- Used `super()` to call parent constructors.  
- Must be the **first line** inside child constructors.  
- Ensured proper initialization of inherited attributes.  
- Example hierarchy:

Person
│
├── Student (gpa)
└── Employee (salary)


---

## **Day 07 — Method Overriding 🐟➡️🏃**
- Redefined parent methods in child classes.  
- Achieved **runtime polymorphism**.  
- Example:
  - `Animal.move()` → running  
  - `Fish.move()` → swimming  
- Parent method gets replaced when overridden in child.

       Animal
         |
 -----------------
 |       |       |
Dog     Cat     Fish (overrides move)


---

# ⚡ Concepts Covered
- Constructors & Constructor Overloading  
- Arrays of Objects  
- Static Fields and Methods  
- Inheritance  
- Multilevel Class Hierarchies  
- `super` keyword  
- Method Overriding (Polymorphism)  

---

# 🧠 Reflection
Week 4 was where Java truly became **object-oriented**.

You moved from just *using* objects to *architecting* them.  
You learned how Java models real-world entities through class hierarchies, how data flows from parent to child, and how specific behavior can override generic behavior.

> “Once you understand inheritance + overriding, you understand the heart of Java.”

---

# ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **Tools:** VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Execution:** Terminal (javac + java)

---

# 🎯 Next Week (Week 05) Goals
- Deep dive into **Polymorphism**, **Abstraction**, and **Interfaces**.  
- Learn **Encapsulation** with getters/setters.  
- Build a **real multi-class OOP mini-project**.  
- Prepare for **packages**, **access modifiers**, and **OOP design patterns**.

*"Week 4 wasn’t just learning OOP — it was learning how real software is structured."*
