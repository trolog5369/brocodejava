# 🧱 Day 01 — Constructors (Default & Parameterized)

### 📘 Overview
Today’s focus was on understanding **constructors** — the special methods used to initialize objects in Java.  
Learned how constructors help assign unique values to each object at the time of creation.

### 🧩 Files Covered
- `constructors.java`
- `constructors2.java`
- `Student.java`
- `Studentlol.java`

### 🧠 Concepts Learned
- **Default constructors** — initialize objects with predefined values.  
- **Parameterized constructors** — allow passing arguments to set unique values.  
- **`this` keyword** — used to distinguish between instance variables and parameters.  
- Each object can have unique data when initialized through constructors.  
- Constructors are automatically called when an object is created.

### ⚡ Summary
Constructors make object creation flexible and scalable.  
Instead of manually assigning attributes every time, constructors handle initialization automatically — building the foundation for clean, modular OOP design.

> “Constructors aren’t just setup functions — they define how your objects come to life.”
