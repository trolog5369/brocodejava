# 📘 Day 04 — Conditional Statements & Random Class

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
1. **If Statements** — Making decisions in code based on conditions.  
2. **Else If & Else Blocks** — Handling multiple logical paths.  
3. **Nested If Statements** — Embedding decisions within other decisions for complex logic.  
4. **User Input Conditions** — Taking user input and using it in conditional logic.  
5. **Random Class** — Generating random numbers and integrating them with conditions for dynamic behavior.

## 🧩 Mini Exercises
- Wrote several programs demonstrating real-world decision-making.  
- Practiced taking user input and applying conditional logic.  
- Built small random-based decision programs using the `Random` class.

## 🪞 Reflection
Today’s lessons strengthened **logical flow and program control** using Java’s conditional structures.  
Learning how to use **if-else chains** and the **Random class** introduced more interactive and unpredictable behavior in programs — an essential step toward building games and dynamic applications.
