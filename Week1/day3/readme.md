# 📘 Day 03 — Operators & Order of Operations

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
1. **Arithmetic Operators** — Performing basic mathematical operations in Java.  
2. **Augmented Assignment Operators** — Simplifying expressions using `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`.  
3. **Increment & Decrement Operators** — Using `++` and `--` to manage counters and loops.  
4. **Order of Operations (PEMDAS)** — Understanding how Java evaluates complex expressions in the correct sequence.
