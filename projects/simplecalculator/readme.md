### 🧮 Simple Calculator
**File:** `simplecalculator.java`  
**Concepts Used:**  
- Enhanced Switch Expression (Java 14 feature)  
- Arithmetic Operations  
- Input Validation (Division by Zero Handling)  
- Character Extraction from String (`scanner.next().charAt(0)`)  
- Boolean Flags for Flow Control  

**Description:**  
A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`) using **enhanced switch expressions**.  
It also validates user input to prevent division by zero and invalid operators.  

**Sample Input/Output:**
Enter the first number: 8
Enter an operator(+,-,*,/,^): /
Enter the second number: 0
Cannot divide by zero!

Enter the first number: 5
Enter an operator(+,-,*,/,^): *
Enter the second number: 4
20.0


**Learning Outcome:**  
Reinforced knowledge of enhanced switches, user input handling, operator-based branching, and error prevention logic.
