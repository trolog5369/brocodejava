# 💰 Compound Interest Calculator

### 📄 Description
A simple **Java-based Compound Interest Calculator** that takes user input for **principal**, **rate**, **time**, and **number of times interest is compounded per year**, then calculates the **final amount** using the compound interest formula.

This project reinforces your understanding of:
- **User input** via `Scanner`
- **Mathematical operations** using `Math.pow()`
- **Formatted output** using `System.out.printf()`
- Basic **Java syntax**, **data types**, and **variable handling**

---

### 🧮 Formula Used
A = P × (1 + R/N)^(N × T)

Where:  
- A = Final Amount  
- P = Principal Amount  
- R = Annual Interest Rate (in decimal form)  
- N = Number of times interest is compounded per year  
- T = Number of years  

---

### ⚙️ Features
- Interactive **user input** via terminal  
- Calculates **compound interest** with accurate precision  
- Displays result formatted to **2 decimal places**  
- Simple, beginner-friendly logic with clean code structure  

---

### 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Using **Scanner** for input  
- Mathematical computations with **Math.pow()**  
- Output formatting using **printf**  
- Writing clean, modular Java code

### 🧩 Sample Output
===== Compound Interest Calculator =====

Enter the Principal amount: 10000  
Enter the Annual Interest Rate (in %): 5  
Enter the Number of times interest is compounded per year: 4  
Enter the Number of years: 3  

----------------------------------------
Compound Interest Calculation Result:  
The amount after 3 years is $11576.25  
----------------------------------------

Thank you for using the Compound Interest Calculator!
