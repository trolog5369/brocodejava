# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

## 🧩 Overview
The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple console-based Java project that demonstrates the use of **loops**, **conditional statements**, **user input handling**, and **random number generation**.  
It challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range — providing hints until they get it right.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Generates a random number between **1–100**.
- Accepts user input guesses using the `Scanner` class.
- Gives feedback after each guess:
  - `"Too low"` if the guess is smaller.
  - `"Too high"` if the guess is larger.
  - `"Correct!"` when the user finally matches the number.
- Tracks the total number of attempts made by the player.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Random Class** | Generates random integers for the hidden number. |
| **Scanner Class** | Takes user input for guesses. |
| **Do-While Loop** | Repeats until the correct guess is made. |
| **If-Else Statements** | Checks guess accuracy and provides feedback. |
| **Variables & Counters** | Keeps track of the random number and attempt count. |

## 💻 How It Works
1. A random number is generated between 1 and 100.  
2. The user is prompted to guess the number.  
3. After each guess, the program provides a hint.  
4. The loop continues until the user guesses correctly.  
5. The total number of attempts is displayed at the end.

## 🧾 Example Output
Number Guessing Game
Guess a number between 1-100
Enter a guess: 45
Too low! Try again.
Enter a guess: 78
Too high! Try again.
Enter a guess: 60
CORRECT! The number was 60
 # of attempts: 3
