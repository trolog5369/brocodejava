# 🛒 Shopping Cart Project

## 🧠 Overview
A simple Java console-based application that simulates a basic shopping cart system.  
The program calculates the subtotal, applies tax, and displays the final total — helping to understand **arithmetic operators** and **order of operations**.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Accepts prices for multiple items.  
- Calculates subtotal, tax, and total.  
- Uses clear console output to show results.

---

## 🧩 Concepts Used
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).  
- Augmented assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`).  
- Operator precedence and parentheses.  
- User input via `Scanner`.

---

## 🪞 Reflection
This project reinforced **operator mechanics and mathematical logic** in Java.  
It showed how small concepts like arithmetic and assignment can combine into real-world use cases.
