# ⚖️ Weight Conversion Calculator

## 🧠 Overview
A simple Java console-based mini project that allows users to convert weights between **kilograms, grams, pounds, and ounces**.  
The program focuses on mastering **conditional logic**, **user input**, and **basic unit conversion formulas** in Java.

## ⚙️ Features
- Convert between:
  - Kilograms ↔ Grams  
  - Kilograms ↔ Pounds  
  - Pounds ↔ Ounces  
- Menu-driven interface for easy navigation.  
- Accurate conversion with formatted output.  
- Input validation to prevent invalid entries.

---

## 🧩 Concepts Used
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `switch`).  
- Loops for menu repetition.  
- Scanner class for input handling.  
- Data type conversions and arithmetic operations.

## 🧮 Example
Kilograms to Pounds

Pounds to Kilograms

Kilograms to Grams

Grams to Kilograms
Enter your choice: 1
Enter weight in Kilograms: 50
Result: 50.00 kg = 110.23 lbs
