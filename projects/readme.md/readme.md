# 📁 Java Mini Projects – Collection Repository

This directory contains all the Java mini-projects I’ve built throughout my learning journey.  
Each project focuses on mastering a specific core Java concept, gradually increasing in complexity and problem-solving depth.

The goal of this repository is simple:  
**Build fundamentals. Write real programs. Develop clean coding habits.**

## 🚀 What This Repository Includes

A growing collection of beginner to intermediate Java console applications covering:

- Input Handling (Scanner)
- Control Flow (loops, conditionals, switch expressions)
- Methods & Modularity
- Classes & Objects
- Random Number Generation
- String Manipulation
- Basic Math & Logic Building
- User Interaction via Console
- Mini Games & Utility Tools

Each project has its own dedicated folder containing:

- Source file(s)
- A detailed README explaining the problem, logic, concepts used, and sample output

## ▶️ How to Run Any Project

Navigate into the project folder and compile:

```bash
javac filename.java
Then run:
java filename

📅 Current Status

✔ Multiple completed mini-projects
✔ Consistent weekly progress
✔ Expanding into OOP, methods, arrays, and interactive logic
✔ Preparing for larger Java applications & backend structure

📌 Notes

This repository grows as I move through my Java roadmap.
Every project reinforces a concept — no matter how small — and contributes to long-term mastery.
