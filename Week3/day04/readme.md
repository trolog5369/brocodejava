## 🧩 Day 04 — 2D Arrays in Java

### Concepts Covered:
- What is a 2D Array (array of arrays)
- Declaring and initializing 2D arrays
- Accessing elements using nested loops
- Enhanced for loops for rows and columns
- Updating elements using row & column indices
- Printing structured data (e.g., telephone keypad)

### Programs Completed:
1. `arrays2d.java` → Introduction to 2D arrays using separate 1D arrays  
2. `arrays2d2.java` → Direct initialization of 2D arrays  
3. `arrays2d3.java` → Element update using `groceries[row][column]`  
4. `arrays2d4.java` → 2D array representing a telephone number pad  

### Key Takeaways:
- Arrays are **reference types**, so printing them directly shows memory addresses.
- Use **nested enhanced for loops** to iterate through each element in a 2D array.
- 2D arrays are especially useful for **matrices, grids, and tabular data structures.**
