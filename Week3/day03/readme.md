# 🔍 Day 03 - Searching and Varargs in Java

## 📅 Overview
Today’s focus was on two fundamental topics — **Linear Search** (a key DSA concept) and **Varargs** (a powerful Java feature for handling flexible method arguments).  
You explored how to search efficiently within arrays (both integers and strings) and how to replace repetitive overloaded methods with a single, dynamic one using varargs.

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- **Linear Search Algorithm**
  - Searching for integers within an array  
  - Searching for strings using `.equals()` instead of `==`
  - Taking **user input** to perform search operations dynamically  
  - Use of **flags** (`boolean isFound`) and **loop control** (`break`)
- **Varargs (Variable-Length Arguments)**
  - Understanding the syntax: `int... numbers`
  - Eliminating repetitive method overloading
  - Implementing methods that handle multiple or zero arguments
  - Using **enhanced for-loops** with varargs
  - Handling edge cases like empty argument lists (`numbers.length == 0`)

## 💻 Files Practiced
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `searchanarray.java` | Performed linear search on an integer array. |
| `searchanarray2.java` | Implemented linear search on a string array using `.equals()`. |
| `searchanarray3.java` | Took user input to perform string search dynamically. |
| `varargs.java` | Implemented `add()` method using varargs for flexible sum calculation. |
| `varargs2.java` | Implemented `average()` method using varargs and handled empty inputs. |

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **Strings in Java** must be compared using `.equals()`, not `==`, since they’re reference types.
- **Varargs** simplify method design by accepting a flexible number of parameters.
- **Linear Search** is the foundation for understanding more complex algorithms like Binary Search.
- Writing clean, reusable methods improves scalability and reduces redundancy.
- Proper handling of edge cases (like empty arrays) is crucial for robust code.

## 🚀 Reflection
Today built a bridge between **core programming logic** and **DSA fundamentals**.  
You not only practiced structured problem-solving with arrays but also learned how to make your code scalable using varargs — a major step toward writing efficient, production-grade Java code.
