# ☀️ Day 03 - Searching Arrays & Varargs in Java

## 📅 Overview
Today's focus was on **searching elements within arrays** and understanding the power of **Varargs (variable-length arguments)** in Java.  
You built hands-on programs implementing **linear search algorithms** for both integers and strings, explored **user input handling**, and learned how to make methods flexible using Varargs.

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- Linear Search Algorithm (Basic DSA concept)
- Searching integers and strings in arrays
- Handling user input and validation
- Avoiding reference comparison in Strings using `.equals()`
- Using flags (`boolean isFound`) for search logic
- Handling `Scanner` input efficiently
- Understanding and implementing **Varargs**:
  - Using `int...` and `double...` (ellipsis syntax)
  - Looping through variable-length arguments
  - Handling empty argument cases safely

## 💻 Files Practiced
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `serachanarray.java` | Implemented basic linear search on integer array. |
| `serachanarray2.java` | Performed string search using `.equals()` instead of `==`. |
| `serachanarray3.java` | Took user input for target element and performed search. |
| `varargs.java` | Introduced Varargs and simplified overloaded methods. |
| `varargs2.java` | Implemented `average()` using Varargs and handled empty input. |
| `serachanarray4.java` | Practiced integer search with user-provided target value. |
| `serachanarray5.java` | Dynamic array input with user-defined size and linear search implementation. |

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **Linear search** is the simplest search algorithm and works by checking each element sequentially.
- Use `.equals()` for string comparison, not `==`.
- Always close your `Scanner` to avoid memory leaks.
- **Varargs** (`...`) allows passing a variable number of arguments into a method — great for flexibility.
- Check for empty inputs when using Varargs to avoid divide-by-zero errors.
- Combining user input with search logic solidifies understanding of both **arrays** and **loops**.

## 🚀 Reflection
Today’s practice connected Java fundamentals with basic **DSA concepts**.  
Learning to search within arrays and use Varargs gave a better understanding of how data and methods interact dynamically.  
The exercises on user-defined array inputs reinforced problem-solving and logical structuring skills.
