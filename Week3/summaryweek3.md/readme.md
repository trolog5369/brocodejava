# 🚀 Week 03 — BroCode Java Learning Journey

### 📘 Overview
Week 3 focused on **transitioning from basic syntax to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Java.  
The learning curve moved from simple data structures and logic-based mini projects to understanding how **objects**, **classes**, and **methods** interact to form structured, reusable programs.

---

## 📂 Daily Breakdown

### **Day 01 — Dice Rolling Program 🎲**
- Built a **Dice Rolling Simulator** using `Random` and `Scanner`.  
- Displayed **ASCII art** for each die face using **multi-line strings**.  
- Practiced modular code with a separate `printDie()` method.  
- Reinforced loops, conditionals, and randomization.

---

### **Day 02 — Arrays in Java 📊**
- Learned **array declaration, initialization, and traversal**.  
- Used `Arrays.sort()` and `Arrays.fill()` from `java.util`.  
- Practiced **static and dynamic** user input arrays.  
- Focused on **buffer clearing**, **exceptions**, and **enhanced for-loops**.  

---

### **Day 03 — Searching Arrays & Varargs 🔍**
- Implemented **linear search** for integers and strings.  
- Used `.equals()` for string comparison instead of `==`.  
- Introduced **Varargs** (`...`) to handle flexible method parameters.  
- Wrote multiple programs that accepted **user input** and performed searches dynamically.

---

### **Day 04 — 2D Arrays in Java 🧮**
- Understood the concept of **arrays of arrays** (matrices).  
- Accessed and modified elements using **nested loops**.  
- Practiced structured data printing and manipulation.  
- Built programs like a **telephone keypad** representation using 2D arrays.

---

### **Day 05 — Mini Projects (Quiz Game & Rock Paper Scissors) 🎮**
- Applied all previous concepts into small real-world programs.  
- **Quiz Game:** Used arrays for questions, options, and score tracking.  
- **Rock Paper Scissors:** Used `Random` class for computer moves, and loops for replay system.  
- Improved understanding of **logic flow**, **game conditions**, and **user validation**.

---

### **Day 06 — Slot Machine Project 🎰**
- Created a **Slot Machine Game** using arrays, methods, and loops.  
- Practiced **randomization**, **bet handling**, and **payout logic** using switch statements.  
- Modularized program with multiple helper methods:  
  - `spinRow()`, `printRow()`, `getPayOut()`.  
- Focused on improving **problem-solving** and **modular design**.

---

### **Day 07 — Introduction to OOP: Classes & Objects 🚗**
- Learned about **classes**, **objects**, **attributes**, and **methods**.  
- Created `Car1.java`, `Car2.java`, and `objectorientedprogramming.java` to demonstrate OOP.  
- Understood how data (fields) and actions (methods) are encapsulated inside a class.  
- Prepared the foundation for upcoming topics like **constructors**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.

---

## ⚡ Concepts Covered
- Arrays (1D & 2D)  
- Varargs  
- Linear Search  
- Randomization and Game Logic  
- Classes and Objects  
- Encapsulation Basics  
- Modular Code Structure and Method Design

## 🧩 Mini-Projects This Week
| Project | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| 🎲 **Dice Rolling** | Simulated dice rolls with ASCII visuals |
| 📋 **Quiz Game** | Multiple-choice questions with scoring |
| ✊ **Rock Paper Scissors** | Interactive user vs. computer game |
| 🎰 **Slot Machine** | Casino-style slot game with balance and betting |
| 🚗 **Car Class Demo** | Object creation and attribute access using OOP |

---

## 🧠 Reflection
Week 3 was where logic met structure.  
We moved from writing *functional* code to writing *organized, reusable, and structured* programs.  
By the end of this week, the transition into **Object-Oriented Programming** officially began — the key step toward mastering Java.  

> “You don’t just write code anymore — you build systems. That’s what OOP starts teaching you.”

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **Tools:** VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Execution:** Command Line (javac + java)

---

## 🎯 Next Week (Week 04) Goals
- Deep dive into **Constructors**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.  
- Understand **Static vs Non-Static members** and **Encapsulation**.  
- Implement a **multi-class OOP project** applying all concepts.
