# ☀️ Day 02 - Arrays in Java

## 📅 Overview
Today's session focused on mastering **Arrays** — one of the most essential data structures in Java.  
Covered everything from basic declaration and element access to handling user input dynamically and manipulating arrays using built-in methods.

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- Declaring and initializing arrays
- Accessing and modifying elements using indices
- Handling `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
- Using `.length` to get array size
- Creating empty arrays and assigning elements manually
- Taking **user input** to populate arrays
- Handling **static** vs **dynamic** array sizes
- Clearing input buffer (`scanner.nextLine()`) after `nextInt()`
- Using **for** and **enhanced for-each** loops
- Built-in methods from `java.util.Arrays`:
  - `Arrays.sort()`
  - `Arrays.fill()`

## 💻 Files Practiced
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `arrays.java` | Introduced arrays and learned about element access and exceptions. |
| `arrays2.java` | Manipulated array values and used `.length` property. |
| `arrays3.java` | Explored `Arrays.sort()`, `Arrays.fill()`, and enhanced `for` loops. |
| `arrayuserinput.java` | Learned about array size, empty arrays, and manual initialization. |
| `arrayuserinput2.java` | Accepted static user input using a fixed-size array. |
| `arrayuserinput3.java` | Built dynamic array input where the user defines the array size. |

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Arrays in Java are **fixed-size** and store elements of the **same data type**.
- Accessing invalid indices throws a runtime exception.
- You can create empty arrays with a defined size, but not modify the size later.
- `Scanner` input handling requires careful buffer management.
- Enhanced `for` loops are clean and efficient for array traversal.
- The `Arrays` class provides useful utilities for sorting and filling arrays.

## 🚀 Reflection
Today marked a deeper understanding of array manipulation and user interaction.  
The step from static to dynamic arrays helped in building a strong foundation for **multi-dimensional arrays** and **ArrayLists**, which will come next.

## 🗂️ Next Focus
- Multi-dimensional arrays  
- ArrayLists and dynamic data structures  
- Real-world mini-project using arrays (e.g., simple inventory or grading system)
