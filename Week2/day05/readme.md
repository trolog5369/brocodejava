# ☕ Day 05 - Java Basics Practice

## 🧩 Topics Covered:
- **break & continue** statements  
- **Methods** (basic, parameters, return values, and examples)
- **Nested loops**

---

## 📘 Files Included:

1. **breakandcontinue.java**
   - Demonstrates how `break` exits a loop and how `continue` skips the current iteration.

2. **methods.java**
   - Introduction to methods.
   - Shows how methods reduce repetitive code (e.g., printing “Happy Birthday”).

3. **methods2.java**
   - Explains variable scope — methods cannot access variables declared in other methods.

4. **methods3.java**
   - Demonstrates how to pass arguments (`name`, `age`) to methods.

5. **methods4.java**
   - Demonstrates return values with:
     - `square()`, `cube()`, `getFullName()`, `ageCheck()` methods.

6. **nestedloops.java**
   - Explains concept of loops inside loops.
   - Example of printing numbers multiple times efficiently.

7. **nestedloops2.java**
   - User input-based pattern using nested loops.
   - Prints a symbol matrix (`rows × columns`).

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- Use **methods** to eliminate redundancy and improve code reusability.
- **Arguments** allow data to be passed between methods.
- **Return values** make methods more powerful and flexible.
- **Nested loops** are vital for matrix operations and pattern problems.
- **break/continue** help control loop flow effectively.
