# Week 2 — Day 04

## 🔁 For Loops

### Concepts Covered:
- **For Loops**
  - Used to execute a block of code a **specific number of times**.
  - Syntax:
    ```java
    for(initialization; condition; update) {
        // code block
    }
    ```
  - Commonly used when the number of iterations is *known in advance*.

- **Loop Control Variable**
  - Acts as the counter for iteration.
  - Must be initialized before the loop starts, checked in the condition, and updated after each iteration.

- **Increment & Decrement**
  - `i++` → increases the loop variable.
  - `i--` → decreases it.
  - You can also use custom steps like `i += 2` or `i -= 3`.

- **Practical Uses**
  - Counting up or down.
  - Running time-based sequences.
  - Repeating actions for a fixed number of times.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- `for` loops are ideal when you **know exactly** how many times a task should repeat.
- Use `while` or `do-while` when repetition depends on **user input** or **conditions**.
- Loop variables can count up, count down, or skip numbers based on your step value.
- Using loops with random numbers and user input builds **interactive logic** for programs.
