## 🗓️ Week 2 — Day 02  

### 📘 Topics Covered  
- Enhanced Switch (Java 14+ feature)  
- Ternary Operator  
- Method Chaining in Scanner  
- Basic Error Handling (e.g., division by zero)

---

### 💻 Programs Practiced  

#### 1. **EnhancedSwitch.java**  
- Replaced long if-else ladders with the new enhanced switch syntax.  
- Used multiple-case grouping (e.g., `"Monday","Tuesday" -> ..."`).  
- Improved readability and reduced redundancy in conditional logic.

#### 2. **Calculator.java**  
- Built a simple calculator using enhanced switch.  
- Handled edge cases like division by zero gracefully.  
- Reinforced operator-based decision-making.  

#### 3. **TemperatureConverter.java**  
- Practiced **ternary operator** for concise conditional logic.  
- Demonstrated **method chaining** with `scanner.next().toUpperCase()` to handle user input uniformly.  
- Added formatted output with `printf` and Unicode degree symbol (°).

### ⚙️ Key Learnings  
- Enhanced switch improves code readability and avoids fall-through errors.  
- Ternary operator is best used for simple, single-line decisions.  
- Method chaining helps streamline user input processing.  
- Proper validation and formatted outputs are essential for user-friendly programs.
