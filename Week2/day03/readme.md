# Week 2 — Day 03

## 🔁 Loops and Logical Operators

### Concepts Covered:
- **While Loops**
  - Executes code repeatedly while a condition is true.
  - Used to validate user input or run tasks until a condition fails.
  - Example: Asking the user for their name or valid age.

- **Do-While Loops**
  - Similar to `while`, but executes the body **at least once**, even if the condition is false.
  - Useful when validation or user input must run once before condition check.

- **Logical Operators**
  - `&&` (AND) → All conditions must be true.
  - `||` (OR) → At least one condition must be true.
  - `!` (NOT) → Inverts the boolean value.

### 📘 Files
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `whileloops.java` | Demonstrates basic `while` loop usage for user input. |
| `whileloops2.java` | Adds validation examples and introduces infinite loop caution. |
| `dowhile.java` | Introduces the `do-while` loop to handle negative age inputs. |
| `dowhile2.java` | Validates number input using `do-while` loop between 1–10. |
| `logicaloperators.java` | Explains AND, OR, and NOT through weather conditions. |
| `logicaloperators2.java` | Demonstrates logical operators with username validation. |
| `praticeasf.java` | Mini-project combining `while`, `do-while`, and logical operators for age and gender input validation. |

### 🧩 Key Takeaways
- **While** runs only if the condition is initially true.
- **Do-While** runs **once** even if the condition is false.
- Logical operators control complex conditions efficiently.
- Always ensure your loops have an exit condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Combining loops with logical operators allows robust input validation (as in `praticeasf.java`).
