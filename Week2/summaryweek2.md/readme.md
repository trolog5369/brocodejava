# 🚀 Week 02 — BroCode Java Learning Journey

### 📘 Overview
Week 2 built on the fundamentals from Week 1 — focusing on **methods, method overloading, variable scope, and real-world logic building**.  
This week introduced structured programming with **reusable methods** and finished strong with the **Banking System mini-project**.

---

## 📂 Daily Breakdown

### **Day 01 — Methods (Part 1)**
- Created and invoked methods for code reusability.  
- Understood how parameters and return values work.  
- Differentiated between `void` and return-type methods.  

### **Day 02 — Methods (Part 2)**
- Implemented multiple custom methods for specific operations.  
- Practiced input handling inside methods.  
- Worked on better code organization and avoiding repetition.

### **Day 03 — Method Parameters & Return Types**
- Passed arguments between methods.  
- Learned about return statements and method flow.  
- Wrote reusable logic for arithmetic and validation tasks.

### **Day 04 — Method Practice**
- Applied all learned concepts to build functional examples.  
- Focused on input validation, user flow, and cleaner function design.  
- Reinforced method chaining and modular code structure.

### **Day 05 — Method Overloading**
- Learned **method overloading** — multiple methods sharing the same name but different parameter lists.  
- Explored how Java differentiates methods by signature.  
- Understood compile-time polymorphism and practical examples.

### **Day 06 — Variable Scope**
- Studied **local**, **class**, and **static scope**.  
- Practiced accessing variables across methods using static context.  
- Worked with **variable shadowing** and lifetime of variables.  
- Built foundational understanding for class-based programming.

### **Day 07 — Mini Project: Java Banking System 🏦**
- Developed a **console-based banking system** using all concepts from the week:
  - Methods for deposit, withdraw, and balance check.  
  - Class-level `Scanner` object for consistent input.  
  - Input validation for invalid/negative amounts.  
  - Real-time balance tracking and menu-driven user interface.  
- Reinforced practical understanding of **methods, loops, scope, and validation**.

## ⚡ Concepts Covered
- Method creation and invocation  
- Method parameters & return values  
- Method overloading  
- Local vs class (static) scope  
- Variable shadowing  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Building real-world console-based programs  

---

## 🧩 Mini-Projects This Week
- 🧮 **Smart Calculator** — Performed arithmetic using modular functions.  
- 🏦 **Banking System** — Deposit, withdraw, and balance tracking via static methods.  

---

## 🧠 Reflection
This week transitioned from syntax learning to **structured logic building**.  
By coding daily — even through college chaos — each concept was practiced, not just watched.  
> “Discipline outperforms motivation. The code doesn’t care how tired you are — just whether you showed up.”

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java (Core)  
- **Tools:** VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Execution:** Command Line (javac + java)

---

## 🎯 Next Week (Week 03) Goals
- Dive into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
- Understand **classes, objects, constructors, and inheritance**  
- Start writing cleaner, object-based Java programs  
- Build another mini-project integrating OOP concepts
