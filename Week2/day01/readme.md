# 🗓️ Week 02 – Day 01  

## 📘 Topics Covered  
1. **Ternary Operator (`?:`)**  
   - A shorthand for `if-else` statements.  
   - Syntax:  
     ```java
     variable = (condition) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
     ```
   - Used to simplify conditional expressions and make code concise.  
   - Practiced examples:  
     - Checking pass/fail based on score.  
     - Checking even/odd number.  
     - Determining AM/PM based on time.  
     - Setting tax rate based on income.

2. **Weight Conversion Program**  
   - User-input based program using `Scanner`.  
   - Converts between **pounds (lbs)** and **kilograms (kg)**.  
   - Practiced:
     - Taking numeric input.  
     - Using conditional branching (`if`, `else if`, `else`).  
     - Implementing formatted output with `printf()` for decimal precision.  
   - Strengthened understanding of **decision-making in Java**.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Reinforced  
- Conditional logic and branching.  
- User input handling via `Scanner`.  
- Precision formatting in outputs.  
- Writing cleaner, shorter conditional statements using ternary operators.

## 🧩 Files Added  
- `weightconversion.java`  
- `ternaryoperator.java`  

---

## 🔥 Summary  
Day 1 kicked off Week 2 with practical logic-building exercises.  
Learned how to efficiently control program flow with **ternary operators** and applied that logic in a **user-interactive weight conversion program** — solidifying fundamentals for future decision-based projects.
